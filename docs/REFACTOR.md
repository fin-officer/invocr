# Refactoring Notes

## Changes Made

1. **New PDF Processing Module**
   - Created `invocr.core.pdf_processor` module with a `PDFProcessor` class that encapsulates all PDF processing functionality
   - Moved reusable functions from `process_pdfs.py` and `pdf2json.py` into this module
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **New Command-Line Interface**
   - Created `scripts/process_invoices.py` as the new entry point for processing invoices
   - Provides a clean, user-friendly interface with proper argument parsing
   - Includes logging configuration and detailed output

3. **Code Organization**
   - Moved reusable code into the `invocr` package
   - Improved separation of concerns with dedicated modules for different functionalities
   - Added proper type hints and docstrings

## How to Use

### Process Invoices from Command Line

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Process invoices
poetry run python scripts/process_invoices.py \
    --input-dir ./path/to/invoices \
    --output-dir ./path/to/output \
    --log-level INFO
```

### Using PDFProcessor in Your Code

```python
from invocr.core import PDFProcessor

# Initialize the processor
processor = PDFProcessor()

# Process a single PDF
success, message = processor.process_pdf("invoice.pdf", "output")
if success:
    print("Processing successful!")
else:
    print(f"Error: {message}")

# Process a directory of PDFs
results = processor.process_directory("invoices", "output")
print(f"Processed {results['succeeded']} files successfully")
print(f"Failed to process {results['failed']} files")
```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Better Code Organization**
   - Code is now properly organized in a Python package
   - Clear separation of concerns between different functionalities

2. **Improved Reusability**
   - Core functionality can be easily imported and used in other parts of the application
   - Consistent API for PDF processing

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Comprehensive type hints and documentation
   - Easier to test individual components

4. **Easier to Extend**
   - New processing methods can be added to the `PDFProcessor` class
   - The command-line interface can be extended with new features

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for the new `PDFProcessor` class
2. Consider adding more advanced PDF processing features
3. Add support for additional output formats
4. Implement progress tracking for large batches of files
